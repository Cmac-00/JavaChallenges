1.
Create an interface IMyShape.java to represent a shape.  The interface should include the method signatures

               double calculatePerimeter();

               double calculateArea();

               String getShapeName();

2.
Develop three classes, each of which implements the IMyShape interface.  The classes should represent a circle, square and rectangle respectively.  Choose appropriate instance variables for each class and initialise these in the constructor of each.

 

3.
Create a class to for an ad hoc test of the implementations. 

Write a method of the class randomly generate ten shapes (a mixture of circles, squares and rectangles) and store them in an array or arraylist.

Few hints :

//array to hold shapes of all three types
IMyShape myShape[] = new IMyShape[NUMBER_OF_SHAPES];

so.. this may be useful...


4.
Write a method  that displays the name, area and perimeter of each shape in the array / arraylist.

Remember we are programming to the interface so ... so the output loop will look something like this...

for (IMyShape shape : myShape){
    System.out.print(shape.getShapeName());
    etc....

}

 

5.
In the same method output the details for each specific shape eg output the circle radius, the square's side & the rectangle's breadth and height.

Hint : 

if (shape instanceof MySquare) {
                MySquare square = (MySquare)shape;
                System.out.printf(" Square length %.2f",square.getLength());
