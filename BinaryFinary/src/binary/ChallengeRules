iven the following array that represents an 8 bit (non signed) binary number 

boolean[] eightBitArray = { true, false, false, true, false, true, false, true };

write a method that will output the array as a 0 or 1 based number representation; where true =1 and false = 0 i.e. 

1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 

Feeling like a REAL challenge ?

Write a method that'll output the decimal value of the 8 bit number in the array.

i.e.  As decimal : 149
