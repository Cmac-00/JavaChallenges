Write a program that'll have the expected actions and output for a simple quiz. 

Actions:

1. The user should be given a random question from the question Array (see below)

2. User responds

3. User answer should be checked against the answer in the answer Array (see below)

4. User is notified of outcome

5. User is prompted to continue (get another question) or quit

Expected output
Use these arrays for the questions and answers (the index of the question corresponds to the index of the answer) eg sampleQuestions[0] has the answer sampleAnswers[0]

// declaring the questions and answers
String[] sampleQuestions = { "Largest planet ? ", "Fastest Animal ? ", "Capital of Peru?",
"Roman god of War ?" };
String[] sampleAnswers = { "Jupiter", "Cheetah", "Lima", "Mars" };
