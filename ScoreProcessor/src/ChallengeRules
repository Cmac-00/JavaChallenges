Score processor

Given the results for the first number of weeks of a football league season write a program that will process the scores and output the statistics for each team (ordered by Team name) and the current league standings (ordered by points).   The results are provided in a text file (Results.txt  Download Results.txt).

The result for each match is guaranteed to be in the format:

<Team1 Team1Score Team2Score Team2>

e.g. Arsenal  4  Spurs  0.                   

Note : Each team name is one string (i.e. no spaces). 

Development suggestions

Develop a class to store the details for each team to support the application output, e.g. Team name, Played, Goals For, Goals Against, Win, Draw, Loss and Total Points.

Read each line (match result) in the text file.

Use a Collections Map
E.g. private static Map<String, Team> teams = new HashMap<String, Team>();
(String being the team name and Team being the class developed in step 1.)


Process the results – (There are 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss.)

To output the individual team statistics, order the values (alphabetically) by team name, hint use a SortedSet 

To output the League tables convert the values in the HashMap to a List Develop and use a comparator to order (sort) by Points.
